Or, happy new year (2<sup>6−1</sup>)(2<sup>6</sup>−1).

We just wrapped up a long-running big data project.  While I didn't find the
project itself particularly interesting, I learned quite a bit of interesting
stuff doing it.

On the skills side, I learned [Go](https://golang.org),
learned how to navigate AWS,
and gained a good understanding of how cluster data stores work.

But probably the most important takeaway from last year is summarized
neatly in [this blog post](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html) from 2010, recently sent to me by a coworker.
In a nutshell, there are a lot of big data systems that are far
larger and more complicated than they need to be for the data that
they are designed to process.
