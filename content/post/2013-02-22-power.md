Finished a user athentication system today using [BCrypt::Password](http://bcrypt-ruby.rubyforge.org/classes/BCrypt/Password.html).

There was an Aha! moment when I realized that they've defined the `==` operator to return true when the password matches, not when the strings are equal (as a novice like me might expect).

{{< highlight text >}}
1.9.3p385 :002 > secret = BCrypt::Password.create("password")
 => "$2a$10$50UZDPv124TYHe4xwQLoBeuryd0lzcCkjVdepHQD41K9svNE7lXGe"
{{< /highlight >}}

The hashed secret is saved in the database.&nbsp; It's later retrieved and checked against the user input using `==`.

{{< highlight text >}}
1.9.3p385 :005 > secret
 => "$2a$10$50UZDPv124TYHe4xwQLoBeuryd0lzcCkjVdepHQD41K9svNE7lXGe"
1.9.3p385 :006 > q = BCrypt::Password.new(secret)
 => "$2a$10$50UZDPv124TYHe4xwQLoBeuryd0lzcCkjVdepHQD41K9svNE7lXGe"
1.9.3p385 :007 > q == "password"
 => true
{{< /highlight >}}

This also has the interesting side effect that `==` is not commutative.

{{< highlight text >}}
1.9.3p385 :008 > "password" == q
 => false
{{< /highlight >}}

My junior high math teacher would be disturbed by this.&nbsp; Such is the power of Ruby.
